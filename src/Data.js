  description:
    "My knowledge is of a wide range. From photo and video editing, to 3D and UX/UI design and from programming, to mobile applications development. Lately though I discovered a new passion, Virtual and Augmented Reality! My focus now is on AR/VR and immersive computing. My tools among others are Unity, C#, Maya, Blender, Photoshop, Visual Studio, and After Effects. I am mainly a generalist but I can be flexible when itâ€™s needed. I am also up to date with Agile methodologies like Scrum, Lean Software Development and Kanban.",
